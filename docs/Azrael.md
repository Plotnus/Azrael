## About ##
Azrael is my take at a modernized twin stick genre.
In a sentence it as a twin-stick, ability based, rpg shooter.
It has an emphasis on player playstyles.
If I were to give this genre a name it'd be a loot&shoot.

## Feels ##
Snappy. Tight control. High mind-meld.
Edge of your seat. How did we survive that?
Exploration of different playstyles.

## High Level Mechanics ##
Hordes of diverse enemies.
Diverse playstyles.
Abilities.
Arena.
High Skillcap.
