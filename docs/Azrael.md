## About ##
Azrael is my take at a modernized twin stick genre.
In a sentence it as a twin-stick, ability based, rpg shooter.
It has an emphasis on player playstyles.
If I were to give this genre a name it'd be a loot&shoot.

## Feels ##
Snappy. Tight control. High mind-meld.
Edge of your seat. How did we survive that?
Exploration of different playstyles.
Over all the player should feel in control. If they ever fail they should be able to think about how they could have handled the situation differentely to have a better outcome. I had this feeling whenever I died in battle ground on my mage in World of Warcraft.
Players focus should be on the situation and how to manage it, not extraneous information.

## High Level Mechanics ##
Hordes of diverse enemies.
Diverse playstyles.
Abilities.
Arena.
High Skillcap.
Scoring?

[World of Warcraft-Frostmage] - Great toolkit. Good balance of short and long cooldown. Could control and influence the way things played out through CC, and slows.

[World of Warcraft-AfflictionWarlock]- Great example of managing resources. You could speed level and continuously pull by creatively using abilities that would exchange health and mana and vice versa. For some abilities you could'nt move.

# In-General / Team-Stuff
- Empower one-another, trust one-another
- Our ideas are simply hypothesis and should be tested.
- Be proud of what you create and own your contribution.
- Don't be over-attached to anything. The game is what matters. Let it reveal itself.
- Brainstorm then only take the best ideas.
- Pride in work, ownership of what we produce, but not an over-attachment to anything in the game. Let the game grow.
- smaller is better - don't invite people to join just so they can contribute one thing and bail.
